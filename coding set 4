#question 1
# start off with the product to a value that ensures the loop starts 
product = 0 
  # loop as long as product is less than 100
  while product < 100

  # grab the input from the user what they put in
  number = float (input("Enter a number: "))
  # multiply the number by 10 and assign it to the given product 

  product = number * 10 

  #that is my trying to create the loop to calulate the inputs user 

  #print the results below
  print(f"The product is {product}")
#I want this message to appear wehn the loop ends
  print("The product is now 100 or greater. Loop ended.")

  # question 2

  wile True:
#get two numbers from the users input
number1 = float(input("Enter the first number:))
number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

  #calulate the sum of them 

  sum = number1 + number2

  #display and show the sum

  #Display the sun

#programming excersise

#question 1 - the bug 

  #start the totalt number of bugs to 0 
  total_bugs = 0

  #create the loop for 5 days

  for dat in range (1,6):
  #have the user for the number of bugs collected for the day 
  bugs_cllected = int(input(f"Enter the number of bugs collected on the day{day}:))

  #add the number of bugs collected to the total verall
  total_bugs += bugs_collected

#show the total number of bugs that are collected

  # question 4 - distance traveled 

  # get the speed of the vehicle in miles per hour 
  speed = float(input("Enter the speed of the vehicle in miler per hour:"))
  # then i am going ot try and get the number of hours the vehicle has traveled 

  time = int(input("Enter the number of hours the vehicle has traveled: "))

  #question 11 - weight loss

  #grab the users starting weight 

  starting_weight = float(input("Enter your starting weight (in pounds):"))

  #next define the weight loss per month
  print ("/nMonth/tExpected Weight (lbs)")
  print ("---")

  #calulate and show the expected weight for each month 

  current_weight = starting=weight
  for month in range (1,7):

  print(f"{month/t{current_weight:.2f})

  #question 14

  #first we define the number of ros for the patterne 

  rows = 7
  # use the nested loops to generate the pattern 


  for i in [7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
    for j in range (i):
print('*', end= '')
print ()
# then have it ove the next line each row
