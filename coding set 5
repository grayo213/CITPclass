# above I tried to display the action I made on line 11 - But i am not sure why it wont print, or maybe I am clickling the wrong thing  
# in lines 2-4 I defined what the problem 
# the function I made is me tyring to multiply the argument x by 10 

#algorith workbench number 2

show_value(12)
 #the function aboce is the single parameter the 'quantity'
# i am going to call the function and then write it out

show_value(12)
#the output of this code shoudl be the value which is 12
