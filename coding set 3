#the "calulate_weight" function is taking mass as a parameter and calulating the weight using the formula - weight = mass * 9.8, then it gives us the calulated weight, the the main prgorma whcih is lines 61-63 are me trying to prompt the user to enter the mass of the object in kilograms using the unput 
# then after using the input, we convert it to gloat using the vairble "mass"

#   i tried to make it so the program calulates the weight of an object based on the mass
