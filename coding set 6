#for line 3 i am opening the file by using the file named 'my_name.txt' in write mode (''w''), then the with statment is making sure the file is closed correctly adter the block of code is printed and executed
# i am trying to go more in depth with my explainations and iterations, hopefully these are better
# I call the 'open' file so it opends the file in the specific mode. This is indicating that the file is opened for writing like I want it to be  
#the the 'write' operation is the 'file.write('I love to code even though it is hard' and that is the operation of writing the text i put in the quotes
#the lastly the close file enures that the files closes, it is the 'with' block and makes it so it automaticaly closes at the end

# Open the file names 'number_list.txt' in append mode 
with open('number_list.txt', 'a') as file: 
  # Write a list of numbers to the file 
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
  for numbers in numbers: 
    file.write(f{number}/n) # Wrtie each number on a new line 

# The file is automtically closed after the 'with' block ends 
#the 'open' file is called witht the mode ''a'' to make sure that it will stick witht he file similar to number one above with calling the name 'my_name.txt' 
#then is writes the operation, 'for' loop iterates the list 'numbers'. Then for each the numbers they are written to the file then followed by the new charachter
# I chose to open the file in the begining simialr to how I did in the first answer
